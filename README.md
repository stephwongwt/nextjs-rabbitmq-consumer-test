# RabbitMQ consumer with a Next.js frontend

A basic example to show how a RabbitMQ consumer can be created with express, and use server side event to send the consumed messages to the frontend.

All packages need to be installed.

start node-be-producer with `npm run start`

start nextjs-fe with `yarn dev`

start sse-be-consumer with `yarn start`


_Note that this project only serves as a very basic example to prove the concept._
